/**SMALL NOTE BEFORE YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE PROJECT**/

Hi Hiring Team,

I hope you are having a great day.

Thank you for checking out my build. I must mention that I currently don't have a paid version of Photoshop, so I wasn't able to extract the assets (such as images) from the layers of the PSD file. However, I didn't let that stop me from working on the project. I did my best to recreate each component based on the PDF version of the file(converted the psd to pdf online). I tried to incorporate all the features as I could interpret from the PDF. The project presented some challenges, but I enjoyed tackling them.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

I have given it my all.

Thank you,
Victor Mitra
